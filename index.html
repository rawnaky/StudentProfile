					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>My passion for IT stems from its creative aspect which is also helped by the fact I love learning and discovering new things. Our current society is shaped by IT and is rooted in almost every industry, my eventual goal is to start a company or companies which change our way of living using emerging technologies in IT. As an 8 year old on an expedition through the vast collection of software on our family computer I discovered a software called Adobe Dreamweaver, using which I created quite a few websites using gifs I found on the internet and pictures of art and other things which I made. I studied software development and computing in VCE and have some knowledge in creating new software using visual basic and we also learned the basics of python as well, a language which I love very much and find a delight to use. I have some experience in IT in terms of “professional” work such as helping my mum set up her shop on Amazon, Etsy, eBay and her Shopify website but other than that I have no professional experience in IT. <br> <br>
						I chose to come to RMIT as I always found it more accessible than the other universities in Melbourne and it feels very welcoming. As I want to eventually start my own company in this field I want to gain enough knowledge in order to study further and grow my network of people who share the same passions as me but also complement my skills and weaknesses.

					<h2>Myers Briggs Type Indicator</h2>
					<p>Commanders are natural-born leaders. People with this personality type embody the gifts of charisma and confidence, and project authority in a way that draws crowds together behind a common goal. However, Commanders are also characterized by an often ruthless level of rationality, using their drive, determination and sharp minds to achieve whatever end they’ve set for themselves. Perhaps it is best that they make up only three percent of the population, lest they overwhelm the more timid and sensitive personality types that make up much of the rest of the world – but we have Commanders to thank for many of the businesses and institutions we take for granted every day.</p>
					<h3>Strengths</h3>
					<p>Efficient, Energetic, Self-Confident, Strong-Willed, Strategic Thinkers  </p>
					<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
					<p>Stubborn and Dominant, Intolerant, Impatient, Arrogant </p>
					<h3>Team Composition</h3>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>
			
			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>a shopping platform that utilises augmented reality to showcase new products in one unified store. This can range from laptops and phones to everyday items like toothbrushes, anything the seller wishes to display a true scale version of their products to replace physical stores saving them significant costs. In the current state of the world, anything that can be done online is being don’t online and so is shopping. </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>The number of online shop spending had skyrocketed in 2020, jumping 41% compared to the average in 2019 and accounting for, although in 2021 it's projected to shrink slightly back to the original numbers for 2021. The main problem with online shopping at the moment is the lack of customer trust due to not being able to touch and feel the products. Sometimes people find themselves checking out a product in person before buying it online. This could be mitigated by using an augmented reality technology to display products so customers wouldn’t need to visit the stores and increasing customer trust in shopping online. </p>

					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>This marketplace would be something similar to Amazon or eBay where sellers would give up a portion of their sales to use the storefront and the AR technology. The store would feature an Ai powered curation system to find products the user is most likely to buy depending on their location, time of day, previous purchases and previously searched products, some spots could be auctioned similar to google AdWord to find the most relevant ad for the highest amount the seller wants to spend to get a new customer. A search bar would be featured in the top section of the page with a camera icon on the right side, pressing which an image selector popup would come up where you can take an image or use an image from camera roll and after selecting an image a similar product or the same product would be shown using an AI image search .  Initially, orders would be shipped by the sellers themselves but after the revenue increases, they would be able to choose to stock their products in our warehouses which would be shipped when orders are filled. </p>

					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>For this project, we would need a 3d modelling software such as Cinema 4D or Maya. To show these models Google’s ARcore SDK would need to be implemented into the website which would feature an AR button next to each product page and on the featured page for the big images or web-based app scaled using reactive design. For this website and web app, a cloud service would need to be implemented either google cloud or AWS, google cloud would be a cheaper option and would be better for this project as it has better integration and existing documentation on implementing cloud-based AR solutions and is developed by the same company. </p>
